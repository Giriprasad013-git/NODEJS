Assume there is an Apartment in Mangalore. In this apartment there is an ASSOCIATIOn which is madeup of many people. This ASSOCIATIOn is in need of a Online System in which they can manage the Whereabouts of each FLAT.
For e.g.: The ASSOCIATIOn gives Many Amenities in the Apartment like Cleaning, Water, Electricity, Lift, etc. For these services the ASSOCIATIOn usually has a Maintenance Fees to be paid per FLAT without fail each month. In the similar lines, ASSOCIATIOn will provide GAS and Collects Garbage from each FLAT, for which also fees has to be paid per FLAT each month.
